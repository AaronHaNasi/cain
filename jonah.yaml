          Pick a blasphemy power. You can increase the dice and CAT of that
          power by +1 the next time you use itm but then you cannot use any
          blasphemies again and all actions are hard. Both of these effects
          end when you rest

            Spend a psyche burst and roll PSYCHE to produce a weaponized
            form of concentrated psychic energy in melee or short range.

            You can take an Unstable Power hook as part of using any Ardence
            power to increase the CAT of the power up to +2. When the hook fills
            up, you burn up from the inside, gaining an injury and ending the
            hook. If this injury would kill you, you explode in an area equal
            to your CAT, annihlating yourself and everything inside in a
            massive explosion. Nothing can survive this
